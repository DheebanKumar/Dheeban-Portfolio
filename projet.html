<h1><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPj9dTIqymZ3mSVu5eG_jB-EOheeEmGh/view?usp=drivesdk">Smart Banana Leaf Disease Classifier Using Convolutional Neural Network</a></h1>
<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>The "Smart Banana Leaf Disease Classifier" employs Convolutional Neural Networks to swiftly and accurately identify diseases in banana plants from leaf images, aiding farmers in proactive disease management and ensuring optimal crop health and yield.</p>

<h2>Data:</h2>
<p>Classify banana leaves into 13 categories (1 healthy class, 4 diseased classes, and 8 deficient classes) using deep learning models. Utilized images from Mendeley dataset and MUSA dataset, which contained noisy and inconsistent data.</p>

<h2>Methodology:</h2>
<p>Employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures like AlexNet and VGG-16 for classification. Implemented image pre-processing using Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) technique.</p>

<h2>Outcome:</h2>
<p>Identified AlexNet Model 4 with learning rate 0.0001, epoch of 10, and ADAM optimizer as the suitable model, achieving an accuracy of 96.15%.</p>

<h2>Implementation and Integration:</h2>
<p>Integration with Dropbox: Stored DL models in Dropbox and generated an access token for app access.</p>
<p>Integration with ThingSpeak: Utilized MATLAB analysis tab in ThingSpeak for downloading trained (.mat) files from Dropbox and resizing input images accordingly. Implemented a classifier to classify the input image and display the class name as output.</p>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/DheebanKumar/Food_Order_App.git">Online Food Ordering System</a></h1>
<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>The "Online Food Order System" is a Java-based application designed to facilitate food ordering and delivery. The system is inspired by popular online food delivery platforms like Swiggy. It provides users with a user-friendly interface to browse through menus, place orders, and provide feedback.</p>

<h2>User Registration:</h2>
<p> Users can register with the system by providing their address and mobile number. An OTP (One Time Password) verification process ensures security during registration.</p>

<h2>Menu Display:</h2>
<p> The system displays a menu with various food items and their respective prices, mimicking the offerings of a typical restaurant or food delivery service.</p>

<h2>Order Placement:</h2>
<p> Users can select items from the menu and add them to their order. The system calculates the total bill dynamically as items are added.</p>

<h2>Order Confirmation and Cancellation:</h2>
<p> Users have the option to confirm or cancel their order before finalizing it. Confirmation displays the total bill, while cancellation aborts the order process.</p>

<h2>Feedback Submission:</h2>
<p> After completing an order or at any time during their interaction with the system, users can provide feedback, contributing to the improvement of the service.</p>

<h2>Future Enhancements:</h2>
<p>Integration with a database to store user details, menu items, and order history.
  Implementation of user authentication for secure access to the system.
  Incorporation of real-time order tracking and delivery status updates.
  Integration with online payment gateways for seamless transactions.</p>

<!--<h2>Outcome:</h2>
<p>Achieved state-of-the-art translation performance on multiple language pairs, with BLEU scores surpassing existing benchmarks.</p>

<h2>Implementation and Integration:</h2>
<p>Deployed the translation system as a web application accessible via RESTful API endpoints. Integrated with popular translation APIs for comparison and benchmarking purposes.</p>
